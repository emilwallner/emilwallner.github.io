    <div class="text-content"><p>It has never been simpler to create a personal website than it is today. There are dozens, if not hundreds of companies that provide you with all the tools you need to create your own personalised platform of unfiltered self-expression. If you have the skills and knowledge to design and build one yourself, that’s even better, but today, (almost) anyone can create a site for themselves. Even setting up hosting and buying a domain name is easier than it has ever been.</p>
<p>If you’re building a blog, digital self-expression is not only important, it’s a fundamental freedom we are all afforded, and one we should embrace.</p>
<p>In today’s digital landscape, having a space to create and write what you like and how you like is valuable, if even in principle. You make the rules. You needn’t care whether people like, retweet, upvote, applaud, or comment on your words. You can write mindfully—with meaning, substance, and creative freedom.</p>
